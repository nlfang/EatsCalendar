App Brainstorming
===
## App Ideas
1. Todo list/calendar
    - Allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks. Provides the ability to view those tasks in a list or calendar view.Combines the functions of a todo list and calendar to help users manage their tasks and events efficiently.
3. Spotify/Apple Music stats
    - Allows users to login using their Spotify or Apple Music accounts to view personal stats like most or recently played tracks/genres/artists. Functions similarly to Spotify Wrapped.
5. CityBus tracker
    - Allows users to view each bus route and the live locations of the busses on those routes. Gives users the ability to select certain stops on the routes and let the app send a push notification for when the bus gets to the selected stops. Users could select a stop before their designated stop to give themselves enough time to get ready to leave.
7. Recipe finder/tracker
    - Lists recipes along with their prep time. Helps users find recipes for certain dishes and schedule when they will make the dish. Shows recipes on a table and calendar view.

## App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Recipe finder/tracker
   - **Description**: Lists recipes along with their prep time. Helps users find recipes for certain dishes and schedule when they will make the dish. Shows recipes on a table and calendar view.
   - **Category:** Food
   - **Mobile:** Being an app allows users to quickly pull up recipes that they are interested in. It also gives easy access to see what food plans they have made for the week.
   - **Story:** The app makes it easy to decide on what to have for meals throughout the week.
   - **Market:** Everyone who cooks or makes dishes.
   - **Habit:** Those who cook can use this every day to either view recipe steps while they cook or plan meals for the future.
   - **Scope:** The app shouldn't be too hard to complete before the end of the program. A stripped-down version of the app would still be interesting to build, though there may not be enough functionality for it to actually be useful to people. This app is well-defined.
2. CityBus tracker
    - **Description**: Allows users to view each bus route and the live locations of the busses on those routes. Gives users the ability to select certain stops on the routes and let the app send a push notification for when the bus gets to the selected stops. Users could select a stop before their designated stop to give themselves enough time to get ready to leave.
   - **Category:** Transportation
   - **Mobile:** Being an app allows users to quickly see where the bus is and get push notifications when a bus reaches a selected stop.
   - **Story:** The app makes it easy to take the bus and plan trips.
   - **Market:** Everyone who rides the CityBus.
   - **Habit:** Whenever someone needs to ride the bus, they can use my app to check where the bus is and plan accordingly.
   - **Scope:** This app will be difficult to complete before the end of the program. A quick search online shows that there is data available for the bus routes, but live tracking information isn't available. A stripped-down version of the app would still be interesting to build, though there may not be enough functionality for it to actually be useful to people. This is in part due to the fact that a CityBus app already exists with live bus tracking information, but there is no ability to get push notifications when a bus reaches a stop. Thus, I would basically be rebuilding an app that already exists. This app is well-defined.

## Final Idea
I've decided on the recipe finder/tracker app.
